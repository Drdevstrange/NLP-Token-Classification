# NLP-Token-Classification
Abbreviation and Long-Form Detection using Classical, Deep Learning, and Transformer-Based NLP Models

This project focuses on token-level sequence classification for detecting abbreviations and their corresponding long forms in scientific/technical text using the PLOD-CW-25 dataset.

The objective is to design, implement, compare, and deploy multiple NLP modeling approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning and transformer-based architectures.

The project was developed as part of the NLP (COMM061) coursework at the University of Surrey.
